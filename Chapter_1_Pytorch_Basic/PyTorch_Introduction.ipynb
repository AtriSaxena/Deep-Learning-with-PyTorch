    "\n",
    "* PyTorch doesn't simply bind Python to the overall C++ framework. It's built on top of Python. You can use PyTorch as easily as numpy/scipy/scikit-learn, or you can use your favorite libraries and packages in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* PyTorch's design philosophy is linear, intuitive and easy to use. When you need to execute a line of code, it will execute faithfully. PyTorch has no asynchronous worldview. When you open the debugger, or receive error codes and stack traces, you will find it easy to understand the information. The Stack-trace point will point directly to the exact location of the code definition. We don't want you to waste time when debugging, because of incorrect pointing.\n",

    "* PyTorch has a lightweight framework that integrates various acceleration libraries such as Intel MKL, NVIDIA's CuDNN and NCCL to optimize speed. At its core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends (TH, THC, THNN, THCUNN) are written as stand-alone libraries with the C99 API."
